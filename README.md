# Guide to Writing Samples in this Repo
Thank you for visiting my Writing Sample repository. I have included three samples of my writing demonstrating varying levels of formality. Each sample was written for a very different intended audience and with a different purpose.

## [InsertArg Script Forum Post](https://github.com/TimRohr22/WritingSamples/blob/main/InsertArg%20Script%20Forum%20Post.md)
This is a forum post introducing users of a VTT RPG site to a new add-on script. The post discusses usage and syntax of the script, and is intended for users with a small amount of technical knowledge, already. The tone is conversational and informal.

## Managing Rights in SharePoint with Groups (Part 1)
This is the first article in a series intended for existing SharePoint users new to SharePoint site administration. The series discusses best practices regarding SharePoint administration, and would be shared with employees within an organization. The tone is corporate informal, designed to be accessible to all levels of previous experience.

## Perrigo DEI Report 2022
This is a public-facing report available on [Perrigo's website](https://s3.eu-west-3.amazonaws.com/perrigo.com/test_perrigo_com_assets/documents/inline-documents/Perrigo%20DEI%20Report%202022_FINAL_5-16-23.pdf), intended to be read by everyone from customers to Wall Street, and the tone reflects that. I was responsible for the Business Inclusion Group content that spans pages 10-13. The tone is public-facing, corporate formal.
